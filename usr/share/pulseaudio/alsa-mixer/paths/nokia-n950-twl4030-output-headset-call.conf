; This path is used in phone calls when a headset is plugged in. This file
; enables playback to the headset. Additionally, the sidetone loop from the
; capture side to the headset speakers is enabled. For the capture side
; configuration, see nokia-n950-twl4030-input-headset.conf.
;
; When playing to the headset through twl4030, the audio is routed through
; tlv320dac33 before it arrives at the headset. See
; nokia-n950-tlv320dac33-headphone-call.conf for the dac33 settings.
