; This path is used when a headset is plugged in, except when a call is active.
; Settings for the call mode are in
; nokia-n950-twl4030-output-headset-call.conf. When a call is not active, the
; tlv320dac33 sink is used, so this file basically shuts down all outputs.
;
; When a headset is plugged in, the headset microphone is used. For the capture
; settings, see nokia-n950-twl4030-input-headset.conf.
