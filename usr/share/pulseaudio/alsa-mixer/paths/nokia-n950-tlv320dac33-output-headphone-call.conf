; This path is used in phone calls when headphones or a headset is plugged in.
; In the call mode all audio is played back to twl4030 - this file sets up
; forwarding twl4030 output through tlv320dac33.
;
; This path doesn't provide hardware volume control, because providing that
; would cause the sink to be muted by the flat volume logic. That's because the
; signal from twl4030 doesn't have a stream object in Pulseaudio, and no other
; streams are directly routed to tlv320dac33 either, so the hardware volume
; would be always set to zero because Pulseaudio thinks that the tlv320dac33
; sink isn't used at all.
;
; Since this path doesn't provide hardware volume, this path must not be used
; in the normal sink for tlv320dac33 output. Instead, tlv320dac33 has to have
; two profiles that create different sinks: the normal one, and one that
; forwards audio from twl4030.
;
; Path configuration for the normal mode is in
; nokia-n950-tlv320dac33-output-headphone.conf.
