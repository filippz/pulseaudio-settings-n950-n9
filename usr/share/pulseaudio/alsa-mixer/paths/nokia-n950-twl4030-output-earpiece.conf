# The sidetone volume level is controlled with this element. Normally this
# element is controlled by a separate module that can dynamically adjust the
# sidetone level to stay constant when the sink volume changes, so this setting
# is usually overridden by such a module. We set the mic loopback to maximum
# volume here statically, so that the sidetone can be tested to some extent
# also without any additional modules.
